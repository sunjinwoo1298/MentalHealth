# MindCare ‚Äì Culturally Sensitive Mental Health & Wellness Platform (Indian Youth Focus)

An AI-augmented mental wellness platform for Indian youth combining:
- Emotionally intelligent AI chat (context-aware: General / Academic / Family)
- Real-time empathetic companion with avatar reactions
- Gamification (Points ‚Ä¢ Levels ‚Ä¢ Streaks ‚Ä¢ Badges ‚Ä¢ Daily & Weekly Challenges)
- Cultural integration (Sanskrit terms, Ayurveda, family & academic pressure context)
- Secure, privacy-first data handling with encryption & RLS
- Proactive interventions & crisis-aware guidance (with human escalation pathways)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This platform supports emotional well‚Äëbeing but does NOT replace licensed mental health professionals. Always escalate critical cases.

## üèóÔ∏è High-Level Architecture

```
frontend/          React + Vite + Tailwind + MUI + VRM + Socket.io client
backend/           Express (TypeScript), PostgreSQL, Redis (planned), Socket.io server
ai-services/       Python (Flask currently) LLM orchestrator (Gemini + sentence transformers)

### Service Interaction Flow
1. Frontend ‚Üí Backend: Authenticated REST + WebSocket (chat & live gamification updates)
2. Backend ‚Üí AI Service: HTTP POST /chat (context, userId, message)
3. Backend ‚Üí DB: Secure CRUD, gamification logic, challenges assignment, streak updates
4. AI Service:
   - Maintains per-user conversation history
   - Vector embedding memory (MiniLM) for semantic recall
   - Emotion classification ‚Üí avatar mood & therapeutic language shaping

## ü§ñ AI System Deep Dive

| Component | Implementation |
|----------|----------------|
| LLM | `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(model="gemini-2.0-flash")` |
| Context Modes | `general`, `academic`, `family` (from `ai-services/context_prompts.py`) |
| Vector Memory | In‚Äëmemory embeddings (SentenceTransformer `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) w/ similarity recall |
| Emotion Tracking | LLM-based JSON extraction ‚Üí fallback keyword classifier (`EMOTIONAL_PATTERNS`) |
| Therapeutic Layer | System prompt (`ai-services/systemprompt.py`) + emotion-guided reflective scaffolding |
| Proactive Messages | Context + recent emotion history + similarity retrieval |
| Fallbacks | Graceful canned empathetic responses if LLM/keys missing |
| Avatar Mapping | AI emotion ‚Üí avatar state (concerned / sad / happy / supportive / excited / neutral) |

### Prompt Design Principles
- Indian youth mental health themes (family pressure, exams, identity)
- Hindi code-mixing for warmth (‚Äúsab kuch theek ho jayega‚Äù, ‚Äúdil‚Äù, ‚Äúmann ki baat‚Äù)
- Encourages reflective disclosure, not diagnostic claims
- Consistently validates feelings before guidance

## üéÆ Gamification System (Multi-Layer)

| Layer | What It Does |
|-------|--------------|
| Points | Earned per wellness / chat / challenge activity (`point_activities`) |
| Wellness Levels | Progressive Sanskrit-inspired level names (see `wellness_levels`) |
| Streaks | Per-activity day-based streak tracking + milestone rewards |
| Badges | Karma badges unlocked via criteria (points, activity counts, levels) |
| Daily/Weekly Challenges | Ayurvedic & traditional practice‚Äìbased structured tasks |
| Challenges Personalization | Dosha compatibility + cultural context fields |
| Achievements | Level + streak achievements logged separately |

### Daily / Weekly Challenges (Fourth Gamification Feature)
- 5 new tables + 11 seeded culturally rooted challenge templates
- Dosha-aware personalization (future-extensible)
- Quality scoring, streak bonuses, cultural bonuses
- Frontend integrates as a dashboard widget (ChallengesWidget)
- Integration tests & status report in `docs/CHALLENGES_INTEGRATION_TEST_REPORT.md`

For full details, see `docs/GAMIFICATION_CHALLENGES_FEATURE.md`.

## üóÑÔ∏è Database & Data Protection Overview

Key Strategies:
- pgcrypto encryption for sensitive columns (suffixed with `_encrypted`)
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies restrict per-user access
- Separation of chat messages vs session metadata
- JSONB for flexible cultural metadata (dosha, preferences)
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

Representative Tables (see `database/schema.sql`):
- `users`, `user_profiles`, `chat_sessions`, `chat_messages`, `interventions`
- `user_points`, `point_transactions`, `karma_badges`, `user_badges`
- `daily_activities`, `streaks`, `wellness_levels`
- `challenge_templates`, `user_challenges`, `challenge_completions`, `challenge_streaks`, `user_ayurveda_profile`
- `mood_entries`, `wellness_activities`, `user_activities`, `emergency_contacts`

---

## üîê Security & Ethics

| Domain | Practices |
|--------|----------|
| Encryption | pgcrypto on sensitive PHI-like fields |
| Access Control | JWT Auth + (planned) Redis session hardening |
| RLS Policies | Users can only see their own rows (explicit policies) |
| Logging | Winston + no sensitive payload logging |
| Crisis Sensitivity | Intervention logs; patterns ready for expansion |
| AI Safety | No medical advice; encourages professional escalation |
| Consent | `has_consent` flag in `user_profiles`; gating logic to be respected by features |

## üß© Backend (Express + TypeScript)

Highlights:
- Routes under `/api/*` (auth, users, chat baseline, wellness, interventions, gamification, audio)
- Centralized `GameService` handles awarding points, streaks, levels, badge criteria, milestones
- Request queue in gamification routes to smooth DB bursts
- Rate limiting (configurable) with relaxed dev bypass for gamification endpoints
- Socket.IO initialization prepared for real-time modules

### Example Gamification Flow
1. Frontend triggers an activity ‚Üí POST `/api/gamification/award-points`
2. Service:
   - Fetches `point_activities` row
   - Upserts into `user_points`
   - Logs `point_transactions`
   - Runs `checkLevelUp`, `recordDailyActivity`, `checkNewBadges`
3. Returns badges earned, streak info, level-up info

---

## üß† AI Service (Python)

Current State:
- Flask app (`ai-services/main.py`) with `/chat` & `/health`
- Dual environment load (`.env` root & local)
- Graceful fallback logic if Gemini key missing
- Structured generation with vector + emotional + contextual augmentation
- Embedding trimming to last N sessions for memory control

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Frontend (React + Vite + Tailwind + MUI)

Feature Surfaces:
- Avatar rendering via `@pixiv/three-vrm`
- Real-time chat UI (Socket.IO planned / partial)
- Gamification dashboard (Points, Levels, Streaks, Badges, Challenges)
- Cultural theming (dosha colors, Sanskrit overlays)
- Component architecture (contexts for auth, gamification)

Key Libraries:
- VRM / three.js stack
- `@tanstack/react-query` (data fetching/caching)
- Radix UI primitives + MUI + Tailwind utility styling
- Framer Motion for animation
- React Router for page flows
